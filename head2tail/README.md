Coding question:
 
There is a common type of word puzzle where you are given two English words of the same length, say, "HEAD" and "TAIL". The puzzle is to come up with a sequence of valid English words, starting with "HEAD", and ending with "TAIL", such that each word is formed by changing a single letter of the previous word.
 
Example (altered letters capitalized):
    HEAD
    heaL
    Teal
    teLl
    tAll
    taIl
 
Create an algorithm to automatically solve such puzzles for any pair of four-letter words, discovering as short a solution as possible, then outputting the chain of words to the console (i.e. print in Python terms), one per line.



$ time python head2tail.py head tail
